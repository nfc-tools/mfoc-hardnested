MFOC is an open source implementation of "offline nested" attack by Nethemba.
Later was added so called "hardnested" attack by Carlo Meijer and Roel Verdult.

This program allow to recover authentication keys from MIFARE Classic card.

Please note MFOC is able to recover keys from target only if it have a known key: default one (hardcoded in MFOC) or custom one (user provided using command line).

This is a port to win32 x64 platform using native tools (Visual Studio 2019 + LLVM clang-cl toolchain).
This tree was also reworked for gnu toolchain (autotool + gcc like the original).
 
Based on the idea by vk496 to integrate mylazycracker into mfoc, forked from his tree.

For credits (there are many) just look at the AUTHORS file.

pthreads4w and liblzma are static linked.
All these libs are precompiled and included in src\lib

# Build from source
Windows:
Make sure you have Visual Studio 2019 with Desktop developement with C++, C++ Clang Compiler for Windows and C++ Clang-cl for v142 build tools installed.
Open the solution and start compile.
The compiled zip package will be in dist.

Linux:
```
autoreconf -vis
./configure
make && sudo make install
```

MacOS:
Same as Linux. Ensure you have libnfc, automake installed (both are available through Homebrew)


# Usage #
Needs libusb0.dll and nfc.dll in the path, better on the same directory.
Needs to install libusbK v3.0.7.0, using Zadig https://zadig.akeo.ie/, go to Option, List All Devices, select your reader, select libusbK(v3.0.7.0) and click on replace driver.
Then go in device manager and disable "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" in your reader under libusbK USB Devices.
Put one MIFARE Classic tag that you want keys recovering;
Lauching mfoc, you will need to pass options, see
```
mfoc-hardnested -h
```
